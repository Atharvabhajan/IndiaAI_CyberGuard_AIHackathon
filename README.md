# IndiaAI CyberGuard AI Hackathon

# Problem Statement: Develop an NLP model that categorizes complaint based on victim, type of fraud and other relevant parameters used for text classification and 
preparing the final model. 

# Impact
The development of this NLP model for text analytics and classification has significant potential to streamline and improve complaint management systems. By categorizing complaints based on factors such as victim type, fraud type, and other relevant parameters, this model:
  * Automates the process of sorting complaints, saving time and resources that would otherwise be spent on manual classification.
  * Provides consistent, data-driven categorization, reducing human error in complaint sorting and ensuring that critical cases are prioritized.
  * Facilitates early detection of common fraud patterns, allowing organizations to take preventive action and strengthen their response strategies.
  * Offers valuable analytics on complaint trends and characteristics, helping stakeholders make informed decisions based on real-time data.
This model can be integrated into broader customer service and security systems, adding significant value to organizations focused on fraud detection, customer support, and incident resolution. Its ability to handle diverse and evolving complaint types makes it adaptable to various industries, including banking, retail, and public services.
